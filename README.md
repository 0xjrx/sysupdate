## üö® Educational Purpose Only
This project demonstrates advanced Linux system infiltration techniques. **For security research and educational purposes only.**

## üß© Overview

SysUpdate is a sophisticated demonstration of the techniques a trojan on Linux would employ, including:

- Covert binary deployment with in-memory packaging
- Persistence through systemd service integration
- Advanced state machine programming
- Obfuscated control flow techniques
- System monitoring capabilities

## üîß Components

### Core Modules
- **SysUpdate**: Remote access utility with shell functionality
- **SysInput**: Keyboard monitoring and input diagnostics

### Technical Features
- Randomized deployment sequence to evade detection
- Flattened state machine architecture (28 distinct states)
- Self-contained binary deployment
- Hidden services with systemd persistence
- Perfect for studying advanced C state machines and system integration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

The project uses a flattened state machine with conditional execution paths:

```c
#define STATE_START 0
#define STATE_CHECK_ROOT 1
#define STATE_SETUP_ACTIONS 2
// ... more states
```

Deployment is randomized for improved evasion:
```c
// Shuffle actions
srand(time(NULL));
for (int i = 2; i > 0; i--) {
  int j = rand() % (i + 1);
  int temp = action_indices[i];
  action_indices[i] = action_indices[j];
  action_indices[j] = temp;
}
```

## üîç Usage Warning

This demonstration requires root privileges. **Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test**.

## ‚è≥ Project Status

This project is currently **under development** and not finished. Future work includes:

- [ ] Include routine if executed without root privileges
- [ ] Improved error handling
- [ ] Memory optimization
- [ ] Additional evasion techniques
- [ ] Cleanup routines

## ü§ù Contribution
